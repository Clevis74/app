# Test Results - SISMOBI GestÃ£o ImobiliÃ¡ria

## Testing Protocol
**IMPORTANT**: This section must NOT be edited by any agent. It contains the communication protocol with testing sub-agents.

### Backend Testing Protocol
- Always use `deep_testing_backend_v2` for backend API testing
- Provide clear task description with endpoint details, expected responses, and authentication requirements
- Test backend FIRST before frontend integration

### Frontend Testing Protocol  
- Always ask user permission before invoking frontend testing agent
- Use `auto_frontend_testing_agent` only with explicit user consent
- Provide detailed task description including UI elements, expected behaviors, and user flows

### Incorporate User Feedback
- READ the previous test results before making changes
- NEVER fix something that has already been resolved by testing agents
- Document all fixes and their test results
- Update this file with minimum steps when adding new test results

## Latest Test Session: "Ocultar Valores" Button Bug Fix

### User Problem Statement
The "Ocultar Valores" button on the Dashboard was not working correctly:
- Button text toggled properly between "ðŸ”’ Ocultar Valores" and "ðŸ”“ Mostrar Valores"
- BUT financial values remained stuck showing "****" instead of revealing actual numbers
- This affected user experience and data visibility

### Bug Analysis
**Root Cause**: Missing `showValues` prop propagation to `MetricCard` components
- `FinancialSummaryCards` and `AdditionalStats` components were formatting values correctly
- BUT `MetricCard` components weren't receiving the `showValues` prop
- Without the prop, `showValues` defaulted to `undefined` (falsy), always displaying "****"

### Solution Implementation
1. **Fixed prop propagation** in `/app/frontend/src/components/Dashboard/OptimizedDashboard.tsx`:
   - Added `showValues={showValues}` to all `MetricCard` components in `FinancialSummaryCards`
   - Added `showValues={showValues}` to all `MetricCard` components in `AdditionalStats`

2. **Simplified logic** in `/app/frontend/src/components/Dashboard/MetricCard.tsx`:
   - Removed double formatting logic: `{showValues ? value : '****'}`
   - Changed to direct display: `{value}`
   - Values are now pre-formatted by parent components

### Test Results: âœ… SUCCESSFUL
**Automated Testing Results** (screenshot_tool):
- âœ… Initial state: Values visible (R$ 0,00)
- âœ… After "Ocultar Valores": Values hidden ("****")  
- âœ… After "Mostrar Valores": Values visible again (R$ 0,00)
- âœ… Button text toggles correctly both ways
- âœ… State propagation works through entire component hierarchy

### Files Modified
- `/app/frontend/src/components/Dashboard/OptimizedDashboard.tsx`: Added missing `showValues` props
- `/app/frontend/src/components/Dashboard/MetricCard.tsx`: Removed double logic, simplified value display

### Verification Status
- [x] Bug reproduced and identified
- [x] Root cause analysis completed  
- [x] Fix implemented and tested
- [x] No regressions detected
- [x] User experience restored

### Next Recommended Tasks
1. Connect React frontend with FastAPI backend APIs
2. Implement "ðŸ“‹ Ver Resumo" modal functionality
3. Address remaining ESLint warnings (177 total)
4. Consider accessibility testing with axe-core
