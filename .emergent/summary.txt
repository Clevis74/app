The previous AI engineer initiated work by attempting to read  for project context, but found it missing. This prompted a broad project exploration, starting with file structure and then specific code files like , , and . Based on this, a comprehensive summary of the SISMOBI project's current state (version 3.1, features, optimizations, accessibility, basic backend) and planned future phases was generated. The user then requested to confirm the current project version, which revealed inconsistencies between documentation (, ) and  (). The engineer successfully updated the  files and created a  for robust version control.

Following a user prompt, the engineer proceeded to expand the backend for version 3.2.0. This involved extensive work: creating , installing new Python dependencies, and implementing a full FastAPI backend with MongoDB integration, JWT authentication, and RESTful APIs for properties, tenants, and dashboard. This phase was characterized by multiple debugging cycles to resolve Python import issues (relative imports, Pydantic validation regex changes). Upon successful backend deployment and health checks, the engineer documented the new API endpoints and functionalities in .

A bug was reported where the updated  content wasn't fully rendered in the preview. The engineer re-verified the file content, identified partial updates, and completely rewrote  to ensure accuracy, also updating the  script. After confirming the fix, guidelines for  consistency were documented in . The most recent task involved fixing a bug on the Dashboard where the Ocultar Valores button was not correctly toggling the display of financial values. The engineer traced the issue to  and , attempting initial fixes. However, further testing revealed the button's text toggles but values remain hidden, indicating a deeper problem with state propagation or data initialization, prompting a debug using  which itself failed to appear.

<product_requirements>
The overarching product requirement is to continue developing and improving the SISMOBI (Sistema de Gestão Imobiliária) application, which is a full-stack React/FastAPI/MongoDB MVP. The initial request was to summarize the existing project status. Specific explicit requests from the user included:
1.  **Summarize Project State:** List the latest instructions and the current state of the project.
2.  **Verify Project Version:** Confirm the current operational version of the SISMOBI application.
3.  **Update Version:** Synchronize  files and project documentation to reflect the correct version (SISMOBI 3.1.0).
4.  **Expand Backend (v3.2.0):** Implement comprehensive backend functionalities including MongoDB integration (models and connection), a JWT authentication system (login, registration, middleware), complete REST APIs for properties, tenants, and dashboard, and structured logging/security validations.
5.  **Fix  Preview Bug:** Ensure the  file displays all updated content, including new backend implementations, endpoints, and future plans, correctly in the interface preview.
6.  **Fix Ocultar Valores Button Bug:** On the Dashboard page, correct the Ocultar Valores button so it properly hides and reveals financial values, maintaining consistency with existing logic and styles from other pages. The button's text should toggle correctly, and the displayed values should change accordingly.

<current_work>
The previous AI engineer was actively working on fixing a critical bug related to the Ocultar Valores button on the Dashboard page. The intended functionality is for this button to toggle the visibility of sensitive financial data (e.g., total income, expenses) between actual values and a masked **** representation.

**Current State of the Bug:**
*   The button's text successfully toggles between 🔒 Ocultar Valores and 🔓 Mostrar Valores, indicating its internal state logic is functioning.
*   However, the financial values themselves remain displayed as **** regardless of the button's state; they never reveal the actual numbers.

**Investigation and Actions Taken So Far:**
1.  **Initial Diagnosis:** The engineer identified that the  component was already applying a  function (which masks values to ****) before passing them to the  component. The  component then had its own redundant  logic, leading to the values always being masked.
2.  **Attempted Fix (Frontend Code Edits):**
    *    was modified to ensure the  prop was correctly passed to  components.
    *    was modified to remove its internal redundant  logic, expecting the value to be pre-formatted by the parent.
3.  **Frontend Accessibility Issue:** During testing, it was discovered that the frontend was being accessed on the wrong port (5174 instead of 3000), which was corrected.
4.  **Persistent Bug:** Despite the code changes and port correction, the bug persisted: the button's text toggled, but values remained hidden.
5.  **Debugging  Failure:** The engineer attempted to add  statements within  (a component likely affected) to debug the  state propagation and data loading. However, these logs did not appear in the browser console output, suggesting that either the  component itself is not rendering/executing, or there's an issue with its import or lifecycle.
6.  **Current Hypothesis:** The engineer suspects an inversion in logic or an inverted initial state for the  variable, or a fundamental issue with data initialization or component rendering that prevents the real values from ever being displayed, even when  is .
</current_work>

<optional_next_step>
Continue debugging the Ocultar Valores button functionality by investigating why  statements within  are not appearing, and thoroughly trace the  state from  down to the  to identify any logical inversion or data initialization problems.
